            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
              Generative AI became mainstream infrastructure in 2023. This change translated into drastic increase in demand for computing power, and thus energy. As deployment accelerates, data center loads would become increasingly large, with high requirements for interconnection and reliability. These can impose steep load increases, putting additional stress on the electric grid. At the same time, countries are trying to decarbonize, reduce pollution from fossil fuels, and renewable energy remains comparatively expensive. Thus unfortunately, our energy generation capacity is unlikely to reach a breakthrough soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that in mind, we founded our company on a simple thesis: make the most out of what we have. We focus on reducing energy waste and end-to-end efficiency with technologies and operating strategies to boost energy efficiency. Guided by the motto “a little of a lot is still a lot”, we believe that even increasing efficiency slightly would yield huge returns over time with huge electricity demand.
